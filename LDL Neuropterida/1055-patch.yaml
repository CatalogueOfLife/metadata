description: The Neuropterida Species of the World (NSW) catalogue documents fundamental
  taxonomic, nomenclatural, distributional (geographic, chronostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic),
  and related information for extant and extinct Neuropterida species on a global
  scale. The catalogue forms one of the fundamental modules of the Lacewing Digital
  Library (LDL) web portal <a href=\"http://lacewing.tamu.edu/\">(http://lacewing.tamu.edu/).
  The Catalogue of Life dataset contains a restricted extract of NSW data that is
  focused on the taxonomy and nomenclature of extant and extinct neuropterid species,
  together with associated bibliographic information. For more complete information
  on neuropterid names and taxa, including extensive information on types, search
  the on-line version of the NSW at <a href=\"http://lacewing.tamu.edu/Species-Catalogue/scspeciescatalogue.cfm\">http://lacewing.tamu.edu/Species-Catalogue/scspeciescatalogue.cfm</a>.
