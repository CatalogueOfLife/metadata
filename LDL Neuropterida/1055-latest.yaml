  taxonomic, nomenclatural, distributional (geographic, chronostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic),
  and related information for extant and extinct Neuropterida species on a global
  scale. The catalogue forms one of the fundamental modules of the Lacewing Digital

  The Catalogue of Life dataset contains a restricted extract of NSW data that is
  focused on the taxonomy and nomenclature of extant and extinct neuropterid species,
  together with associated bibliographic information. For more complete information
