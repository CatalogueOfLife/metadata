title: Universal Chalcidoidea Database
alias: UCD
description: Work on the Universal Chalcidoidea Database was started, with the help
  of small grants from Unilever and Tate & Lyle plc, in August 1991 with the aim of
  making it freely available in electronic format. The Chalcidoidea is a large group
  of insects, currently numbering about 23,000 species, many of which have an important
  impact on major ecosystems and are frequently used for the biocontrol of insect
  pests. The database is intended to provide comprehensive information on the taxonomy,
  biology and distribution of all included species.
