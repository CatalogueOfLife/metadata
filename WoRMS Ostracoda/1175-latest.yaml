alias: WoRMS Ostracoda
description: "The Recent or extant taxa from the World Ostracoda Database-World Register\
  \ of Marine Species includes mostly marine species, and was data-mined from thousands\
  \ of publications (see sources in WoRMS). Concerning the Recent non-marine  Ostracoda,\
  \ very few of the 2,000 species and approximately 200 genera of are included in\
  \ the present data, because they have already been compiled by Martens et al. (2007).\
  \ Concerning the high level classification (i.e., down to family level), we follow\
  \ different authors. The Recent Podocopa classification mostly follows Horne et\
  \ al. (2002), with two exceptions. First, we include Platycopida within the subclass\
  \ Platycopa, while Horne et al. (2002) place it within Podocopa. Second, we place\
  \ the superfamily Puncioidea (which includes a few Recent species) directly in the\
  \ subclass Palaeocopa, while Horne et al (2002) include it within Subclass Podocopa,\
  \ order Palaeocopida and  Suborder Kirkbyocopina. The classification of Recent Myodocopa\
  \ follows diverse classifications of Kornicker and collaborators (e.g. Kornicker\
  \ et al., 2007).\r\n\r\nHorne, D.J., Cohen, A.C. & Martens, K. (2002). Taxonomy,\
