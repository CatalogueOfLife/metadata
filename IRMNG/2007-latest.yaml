alias: IRMNG
description: The Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera is a provisional
  (or ‘interim’) compilation of genus names – including species names in many cases
  – and covers both living and extinct biota into a single system to support taxonomic
  and other queries dealing with e.g. homonyms, authorities, parent-child relationships,
  spelling variations and distinctions between marine and non-marine or fossil and
  recent taxa
