title: Synonymic Checklists of the Vascular Plants of the World
alias: World Plants
description: World Ferns and World Plants are synonymic checklists of the vascular
  plants of the world (including ferns and lycophytes). The data set has been compiled
  over the last 20 years by starting from the basic data of the Kew Index and the
  Index Filicum. These names (roughly 1 million) have been cross-checked against local
  floras, checklists and treatments. In the current status about 95% of the species
  names have been verified, and distribution data are available for about 95% of the
  countries and families (incomplete only for a major part of families in Malesia
  for Sumatra, New Guinea, Moluccas, Solomons and Lesser Sunda Islands). Countries
  without recent checklists include El Salvador, Rwanda, Burundi, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
  Laos, Equatorial Guinea, some smaller Pacific islands, Vanuatu and some families
  of India. The states of the former Yugoslavia have not yet been completely separated,
  and the sixth and last part of the Caucasus and Transcaucasus checklist has yet
  to appear. The listings for the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire) are partially
  badly outdated. Literature for Bangladesh has not yet been received completely.
