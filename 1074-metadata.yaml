title: Early Land Plants Today
alias: ELPT
description: 'The Early Land Plants Today (ELPT) project aims to combine existing
  data on nomenclature, taxonomy and distribution for liverworts and hornworts. The
  project is jointly coordinated by Prof. Lars Söderström (Norwegian University of
  Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway) and Anders Hagborg and Dr. Matt von Konrat
  (The Field Museum, Chicago, USA). This is an internationally coordinated effort
  involving over 40 bryologists from more than 16 countries. The data presented here
  is based on the first-ever worldwide checklist for liverworts (Marchantiophyta)
  and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) published in 2016 and some recent updates after
  that. The checklist and the CoL data are derived from a working database centralizing
  nomenclature, taxonomy and geography on a global scale. As of January 2019 the database
  includes about 39,000 names of about 8,600 ‘accepted’ taxa, a bibliography of more
  than 25,000 references and more than 700,000 distribution records. The data includes
  all extant taxa for liverworts and hornworts and macrofossils closely related to
  them. Prior to this effort a lack of centralization was a major impediment for the
  study and analysis of species richness, conservation and systematic research at
  both regional and global scales. The checklist as well as a list of contributors
  can be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.59.6261. The data maintained
  in the database is constantly growing and has been used for several regional checklists
  and nomenclature summaries of individual families. The data is made available for
  other international databasing and conservation initiatives. This effort has been
  partially funded over the past several years by a variety of institutions and agencies
  including the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, The Field Museum,
  GBIF and the National Science Foundation.'
