title: The World Ciliate Catalog
alias: CilCat
description: The phylum embraces heterotrophic species with a heterokaryotic nuclear
  apparatus, multiple cilia over body, pellicular alveoli, and always an infraciliature
  (highly developed cortical system with kinetid as central feature). Ciliates play
  a significant role in food chains and nutrient recycling; most taxa are found free-living
  in marine or freshwater habitats, while about one third are symbiotic forms, less
  then 10 percent are possibly endemic in soils or known only as fossils, respectively.
