  The idea of this development is to serve as a concise taxonomic backbone for basic
  as well as applied scientific studies. The AnnonBase source database also includes
  references to type material and their location of deposit. This releases includes
  information on vernacular names, distributional data and links to relevant information
  sources. Database development and maintenance has been done at the Austrian Academy
  of Sciences, the Natural History Museum of Vienna, and the University of Vienna
  and was partly funded by the European Commission.
