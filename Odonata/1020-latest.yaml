title: Global Species Database of Odonata
alias: Odonata
description: The Global Species Database of Odonata is a list of all names of extant
  species of dragonflies and damselflies of the world. The present list is based on
  a database built during a period of twenty years. The original information was derived
  from a published catalogue by Davies & Tobin (1984, 1985). However, original publications
  were consulted to check the spelling and original combination of (virtually) all
  names. The present taxonomic status of every name in this list is based on published
  authoritative sources. Addition of the names of fossil taxa, and setting up a management
  committee for this database, are to be expected in the near future. The original
  information of the GSD Odonata is managed using a FoxPro application.
