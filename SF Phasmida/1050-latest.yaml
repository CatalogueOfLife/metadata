title: Phasmida Species File
alias: SF Phasmida
description: The Phasmida Species File (PSF) is a taxonomic database of the world's
  Phasmida (stick and leaf insects, known as walking sticks and walking leaves in
  the U.S.). There is full synonymic and taxonomic information for 3,269 valid species
  and 5,000 taxonomic names, 35,300 citations to 3,000 references, also 7,000 specimen
  records and 16,000 images of 75% of valid species, with more being added to on a
  regular basis. Another future aim of this database is to provide high quality images
  of living phasmids in the wild and in captivity. Colleagues have kindly collaborated
  by providing photos (with particular thanks to Oskar Conle & Frank Hennemann).
