alias: The Scorpion Files
description: The intention of The Scorpion Files is to present an updated list of
  all extant scorpion species and the current situation in scorpion taxonomy. The
  Scorpion Files' family and species lists reflect the most recent published works,
  and not necessarily which system the editor believes is correct. The list does not
  contain synonymy yet. Data have been harvested by Geoff Ower, CoL Database Manager,
  from the original website into CoLDP format.
