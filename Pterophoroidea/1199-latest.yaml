title: Catalogue of the Pterophoroidea of the World
alias: Pterophoroidea
description: This GSD is derived from C. Gielis (2003) Pterophoroidea & Alucitoidea
  (Lepidoptera) (World Catalogue of Insects, volume 4), as subsequently maintained
  and updated by Cees Gielis. The database has been edited for inclusion in the Catalogue
  of Life and updated by Donald Hobern. A current version of the dataset is presented
  as a web document at https://hobern.net/Pterophoroidea. Version 1.1 has been updated
  to correct a number of errors in processing of Cees Gielis' original dataset and
  to reflect recent additions to the group. Additional page references have been added.
