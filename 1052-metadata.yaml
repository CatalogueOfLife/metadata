title: Cercopoidea Organised On Line
alias: COOL
description: COOL is a systematic based database on the Cercopoidea (Froghoppers
  or Spittlebugs). Its purpose is to gather information on the taxonomy, nomenclature,
  bibliography, geographic distributin and host-plants for those insects. The objective
  is to organise the collected knowledge on the froghoppers and to allow an easy access
  to these information to any interested person. This database is on the process of
  being developed. At the moment it is based upon the Metcalf catalogue (1960-1962)
  for the families Cercopidae, Clastopteridae and Aphrophoridae. Since the Epigydae
  were described posteriorly to this catalogue the information concerning this family
  were taken directly from the publication of Hamilton (2001). The Machaerotidae are
  up to date.
