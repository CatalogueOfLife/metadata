title: World Marine, Freshwater and Terrestrial Isopod Crustaceans database
alias: WoRMS Isopoda
description: 'This list began as an initiative of the US National Museum of Natural
  History, Smithsonian Institution, maintained by the late Brian Kensley and Marilyn
  Schotte. It grew into a valuable resource http://invertebrates.si.edu/isopod/ for
  providing nomenclature on the Isopoda: Schotte, M., B.F. Kensley, and S. Shilling
  (1995 onwards). World list of Marine, Freshwater and Terrestrial Crustacea Isopoda.
  National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian Institution: Washington D.C., USA.
  This list is now reconstructed at http://www.marinespecies.org, with more detailed
  information on synonymies and distributions, and a capability to host more information,
  such as images, original literature, and specimen data. This list will be transferred
  on a monthly basis back to the Smithsonian site. Data have been contributed to the
  Catalogue of Life via the WoRMS, hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).'
