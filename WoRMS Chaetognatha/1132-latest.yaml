title: World List of Chaetognatha
alias: WoRMS Chaetognatha
description: The checklist constitutes a list of all currently known and accepted
  species of arrow worms (Chaetognatha). Chaetognaths are small marine predators,
  many of which are planktonic. Arrow worms are found throughout Earth's oceans, including
  the open ocean, tide pools, polar waters, marine caves, coastal lagoons, and the
  deep sea. This global marine species list is part of the World Register of Marine
  Species database, which aims to provide the most authoritative list of names of
  all marine species globally. Data have been contributed to the Catalogue of Life
  via the WoRMS, hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).
