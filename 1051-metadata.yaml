title: Cockroach Species File
alias: SF Cockroach
description: The Cockroach Species File is an up-to-date taxonomic catalogue of the
  world's cockroaches, excluding fossil species. Cockroaches belong to the order Blattodea
  (sometimes known as Blattaria) as too do the termites. In the past termites were
  thought to be a separate order, Isoptera, but recent work confirms that they are
  in fact blattodeans. The CSF includes c. 6,700 scientific names (all ranks, valid
  and not valid) and c. 4,600 valid species are recognised. Images of museum specimens
  (especially types), plus pictures of living cockroaches are slowly being added.
