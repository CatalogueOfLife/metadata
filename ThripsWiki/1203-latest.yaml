title: Providing information on the World's thrips
alias: ThripsWiki
description: ThripsWiki site was designed and produced in Canberra by Inkeri Lehtinen
  with Laurence Mound. Data was drawn from a web-based checklist that since 2005 was
  available through CSIRO Australia, but which for technical reasons has had to be
  abandoned. "Thysanoptera (Thrips) of the World - a checklist" originated from card-catalogues
  maintained over many years at the Natural History Museum, London, and at the Senckenberg
  Museum, Frankfurt. GBIF funded visits to check data at the major thrips collections
  in Frankfurt, London and Washington DC for the 2005 system. The available data has
  been extensively revised and enriched through bibliographic and web searches, and
  production of this new site was supported by DAFF Australia.
