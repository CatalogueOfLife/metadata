title: Psocodea Species File
alias: SF Psocodea
description: 'The Psocodea Species File is a taxonomic database that includes data
  for Psocoptera (bark lice) and Phthiraptera (parasitic lice). Data includes synonymies
  and citations for all recognized species. Parasitic lice are embedded within bark
  lice, and thus the single order Psocodea is recognized for both groups. The Psocodea
  Species File currently contains data from "Psocoptera (Insecta): World Catalogue
  and Bibliography" (Lienhard and Smithers 2002). Updates for Psocoptera are in the
  process of being added. Data from major Phthiraptera catalogs will be added at a
  later date, together with host associations. When completed this database will house
  data from over 10,000 valid species and associated data.'
