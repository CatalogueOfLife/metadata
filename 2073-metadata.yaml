description: "Species Fungorum is a project, based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew,\n\
  to produce an effectively complete global checklist of organisms belonging to\n\
  the kingdom Fungi, and to organisms which were previously included in the fungi\n\
  but are now classified in other branches of the tree of life. It is a collaborative\n\
  project where a small but active proportion of fungal taxonomist, via their publications,\n\
  add to and update the fungal tree of life. With the development of the CoL+ architecture\n\
  the project is simplified by abandoning the thirty-six Global Species Databases\n\
  and recognizing a core of long standing collaborators as follows: Gerald L. Benny,\n\
  Paul F. Cannon, Pedro C. Crous, Tassilo Feuerer, Yu-ming Ju, Bob W. Lichtwardt\n\
  (deceased), David W. Minter, Lisa C. Offord, Jack D. Rogers, Arthur G. Sch\xFC\xDF\
  ler,\nKerstin Voigt, Chris Walker, Nalin N. Wijayawardene, Marvin C. Williams. Species\n\
  Fungorum is built on top of the global fungal nomenclator Index Fungorum, which\n\
  is now a contributor of taxonomically unevaluated names to CoL+ which are not\n\
  included in Species Fungorum as the AVC name or a synonym.\n"
