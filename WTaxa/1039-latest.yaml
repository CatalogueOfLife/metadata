title: Electronic Catalogue of Weevil names (Curculionoidea)
alias: WTaxa
description: The Electronic Catalogue of Weevil Names is a project in progress. Ultimately
  it will contain all family, genus and species-group names in the Curculionoidea,
  a group of beetles with about 60,000 described species which contains many important
  insects, including the bark beetles (Scolytinae) and powder-post beetles (Platypodinae).
  Currently the database contains all generic and family-group names, in their current
  taxonomic position, and based on Alonso-Zarazaga & Lyal's (1999, 2002, 2009) and
  Lyal & Alonso-Zarazaga's (2005) catalogue of weevil family and genus names. Species-group
  names are now added up to the end of 2014. These, and their subsequent combinations,
  have been checked against original publication and current placement for most names
  firstly published before 1801. All these names have been adequately qualified under
  the provisions of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, 4th Edition.
  Many duplicate names appearing in previous versions have been eliminated. M. SÃ¡nchez-Ruiz
  is acknowledged as technical editor for WTaxa database and data export for the Catalogue
  of Life.
