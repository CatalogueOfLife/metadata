  resource in the field of Collembola systematics. The checklist is searchable by
  taxon and is linked, at three taxon ranks (family, genus and species), to global
  distribution maps. In addition, the site contains complementary information including
  biology, identification, collecting techniques, bibliography and images. Crawling
  of the website for the Catalogue of Life was facilitated by Anton Potapov.
