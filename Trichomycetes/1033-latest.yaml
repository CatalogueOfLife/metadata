title: Fungi Associated with Arthropods
alias: Trichomycetes
description: The trichomycetes (Fungi, class Trichomycetes plus ecologically related
  protozoans) are a cosmopolitan group of organisms that grow obligately in the guts
  of insects, crustaceans and millipedes that live in freshwater, marine or terrestrial
  habitats. Many trichomycetes appear to be commensalistic, but under particular circumstances
  they may provide their hosts with some essential organic nutrients. Some are known
  to produce cysts in the ovaries of adult females hosts which, in addition to sterilizing
  the host, serve as a mechanism of dispersal.
