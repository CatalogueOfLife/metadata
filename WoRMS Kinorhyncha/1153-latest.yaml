alias: WoRMS Kinorhyncha
description: Kinorhyncha (= Echinodera) is a taxon of marine animals ranging in size
  from 0.13-1.04 mm body length. The animals live in muddy to sandy sediments or appear
  on algae and invertebrates from the intertidal zone to the deep sea. Kinorhyncha
  feeds on bacteria, algae, diatoms, and detritus. Some 200+ species have been described  based
  on descriptions from adult stages plus 50 species based on the description from
  juvenile stages. Species known only from juvenile stages are generally regarded
  as nomina dubia, but names are available and valid according to the International
  Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The species are grouped in two subtaxa, namely
  Cyclorhagida and Homalorhagida. Further subdivision is in 22 genera using as distinguishing
  characters a) habitus, b) arrangement, shape and surface structure of cuticular
  plates, c) size, shape and arrangement of inner and outer oral styles as well as
  of scalids, and d) size, shape and distribution of spines, sensory spots, gland
  cell outlets and papillae.
