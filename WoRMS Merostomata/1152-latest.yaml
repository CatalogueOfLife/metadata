title: World List of Merostomata
alias: WoRMS Merostomata
description: This global species list of Merostomata is part of the World Register
  of Marine Species database, which aims to provide the most authoritative list of
  names of all marine species globally. There are only four valid recent species of
  horseshoe crabs (Merostomata), but the group has an extensive fossil record not
  captured by WoRMS. The synonymies are mainly drawn from the annotated catalogue
  of the horseshoe crabs in the collections of the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde Berlin by
  Dunlop, Compton & Friederichs (2012). Data have been contributed to the Catalogue
  of Life via the WoRMS, hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).
