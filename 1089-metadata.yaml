alias: SF Embioptera
description: The Embioptera Species File is a taxonomic database of the scientific
  names of the world's webspinners (Order Embioptera = Embiidina = Embiodea). The
  goal of The Embioptera Species File is to foster research and learning on webspinners,
  while increasing our understanding of the world's biodiversity. The Embioptera Species
  File has information for approximately 400 valid species and 600 total names. Both
  extinct and extant species are included. Type specimen information is currently
  available on over half the species. Plans are under development for adding images,
  distributions and ecological information.
