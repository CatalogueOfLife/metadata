title: Global Butterfly Information System
alias: GloBIS (GART)
description: The GloBIS/GART database provides the taxonomic backbone for a global
  information system on butterflies. In addition to the data presented in the Catalogue
  of Life, the original GloBIS/GART database provides information about the type material
  such as type locality, status and current location of the type specimens and images,
  as well as the original and current taxonomic placement. Currently data for the
  families Papilionidae or "Swallowtails" (553 recognized species, more than 2,100
  subordinate taxa), Pieridae or "Whites" (1,108 recognized species, more than 700
  subordinate taxa), and Lycaenidae or "Hairstreaks, Blues, and Coppers" (10,879 entered
  species names, more than 2,000 subordinate taxa) are available, and other butterfly
  groups to follow.
