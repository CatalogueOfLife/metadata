description: 'Species Fungorum is a project, based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew,
  to produce an effectively complete global checklist of organisms belonging to the
  kingdom Fungi, and to organisms which were previously included in the fungi but
  are now classified in other branches of the tree of life. It is a collaborative
  project where a small but active proportion of fungal taxonomist, via their publications,
  add to and update the fungal tree of life. With the development of the CoL+ architecture
  the project is simplified by abandoning the thirty-six Global Species Databases
  and recognizing a core of long standing collaborators as follows: Gerald L. Benny,
  Paul F. Cannon, Pedro C. Crous, Tassilo Feuerer, Yu-ming Ju, Bob W. Lichtwardt (deceased),
  David W. Minter, Lisa C. Offord, Jack D. Rogers, Arthur G. Schüßler, Kerstin Voigt,
  Chris Walker, Nalin N. Wijayawardene, Marvin C. Williams.  Species Fungorum is built
  on top of the global fungal nomenclator Index Fungorum, which is now a contributor
  of taxonomically unevaluated names to CoL+ which are not included in Species Fungorum
  as the AVC name or a synonym.'
