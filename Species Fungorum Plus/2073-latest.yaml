title: Species Fungorum for CoL+
alias: Species Fungorum Plus
description: "Species Fungorum is a project, based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew,\
  \ to produce an effectively complete global checklist of organisms belonging to\
  \ the kingdom Fungi, and to organisms which were previously included in the fungi\
  \ but are now classified in other branches of the tree of life. It is a collaborative\
  \ project where a small but active proportion of fungal taxonomist, via their publications,\
  \ add to and update the fungal tree of life. With the development of the CoL+ architecture\
  \ the project is simplified by abandoning the thirty-six Global Species Databases\
  \ and recognizing a core of long standing collaborators as follows: Gerald L. Benny,\
  \ Paul F. Cannon, Pedro C. Crous, Tassilo Feuerer, Yu-ming Ju, Bob W. Lichtwardt\
  \ (deceased), David W. Minter, Lisa C. Offord, Jack D. Rogers, Arthur G. Schüßler,\
  \ Kerstin Voigt, Chris Walker, Nalin N. Wijayawardene, Marvin C. Williams. \nSpecies\
  \ Fungorum is built on top of the global fungal nomenclator Index Fungorum, which\
  \ is now a contributor of taxonomically unevaluated names to CoL+ which are not\
  \ included in Species Fungorum as the AVC name or a synonym."
