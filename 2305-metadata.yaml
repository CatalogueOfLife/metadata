title: Update on the Brassicaceae Species Checklist
description: 'Here we present a revised species checklist for the Brassicaceae updated
  from Warwick SI, Francis, A., Al-Shehbaz IA (2006). Brassicaceae: Species checklist
  and database on CD-ROM. Plant Systematics and Evolution 259: 249â”€25. This update
  of the checklist was initiated on the basis of recent taxonomic and molecular studies
  on the Brassicaceae that have resulted in new species names, combinations and associated
  synonyms. New data has been added indicating tribal affiliations within the family
  and where type specimens have been designated. In addition, information from many
  early publications was checked and added to the database. The database now includes
  information on 14,980 taxa, 4,634 of which are currently accepted and divided into
  340 genera and 52 tribes. A selected bibliography of recent publications on the
  Brassicaceae is included.'
