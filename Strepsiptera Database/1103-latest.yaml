description: Strepsiptera database is a database on Strepsiptera parasito√Ød group.
  Strepsiptera (commonly known as twisted-winged parasites) is an order of holometabolous
  insects with twelve families (one fossil genus undescribed as a family), making
  up about six hundred species so far with several cryptic species to be described.
  The 1st instar larvae and the short-lived adult males are the only free-living stages
  (except in the family Mengenillidae). The larval stages and the neotenic females
  are endoparasites. The hosts include insects such as bees, wasps, leafhoppers, silverfish,
  cockroaches, grasshoppers, mantids, crickets and fruitflies.
