title: Global taxonomic database of Tineidae (Lepidoptera)
alias: Tineidae NHM
description: 'The Tineidae - the clothes-moth family - comprises more than 2,000 currently
  recognized species (with almost 3000 applicable names) of small to medium-sized
  moths. They differ from all other Lepidoptera in their unorthodox larval biology:
  most tineid larvae feed on plant or animal detritus, lichen or fungi. In addition
  to the data available in the Catalogue of Life, this database also gives information
  on where, when and by whom each taxon was described, and where the original type
  specimen(s) came from.'
