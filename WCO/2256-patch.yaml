description: "The WCO project started with an annotated catalogue of the New World\
  \ Laniatores (Kury 2003). Then it has been expanded to include all suborders of\
  \ harvestmen and all Earth realms, instead of only the Nearctic and Neotropical,\
  \ and is currently in manuscript form as a conventional paper catalogue.   //  \n\
  The current team, led by Kury, started to transfer all information of the MS to\
  \ the TaxonWorks platform in layers, aiming to go deeper and deeper to become a\
  \ repository of various kinds of information on these organisms, but especially\
  \ a complete/reliable/authoritative source of taxonomic/nomenclatural information\
  \ on harvestmen.  //  \nThere is a public interface  at https://wcolite.com, which\
  \ is often updated, and the goals are described in detail in Kury et al. (2021).\
