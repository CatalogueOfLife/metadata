title: Staphyliniformia world catalog database
alias: StaphBase
description: '"The project is an ongoing effort to build and maintain a catalog all
  family-, genus- and species-group names in the beetle group Staphyliniformia (superfamilies
  Staphylinoidea (including Jacobsoniidae), Hydrophiloidea & Histeroidea), including
  all named fossils. All original descriptions were consulted to verify original data,
  and the current status, distribution, and in many cases significant subsequent literature
  and type depositories and type localities for species are indicated. It is an extension
  of the database catalogs initiated as a US-NSF PEET project (see <a href = "http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/peet_staph/"
  target = "_blank"> http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/peet_staph), initially based on
  multiple sources as listed there, but subsequently extensively edited and actively
  updated."'
