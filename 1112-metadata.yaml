title: World Hydrozoa Database
alias: WoRMS Hydrozoa
description: World Hydrozoa database comes from a list of accumulated taxonomic information
  assembled over the years from the literature of Wim Vervoort and Peter Schuchert
  (see Schuchert, 1989). The list of the Siphonophorae was provided by Gill Mapstone
  who also manages the species of this Order. The number of known hydrozoan species
  is about 3800, although the status of many nominal species is currently unclear.
  A considerable number of names also represent synonyms.
