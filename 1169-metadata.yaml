title: Chrysididae Species File
alias: SF Chrysididae
description: The Chrysididae Species File is a taxonomic database of the Chrysidid
  subfamilies Amiseginae and Loboscelidiinae. These understudied wasps are believed
  to be obligate egg-parasitoids of stick insects (see Phasmida Species File). The
  goal of this database is to provide a central point for information about these
  wasps, including their host relationships which are at present poorly understood.
  It is hoped that an up-to-date and centralised database will facilitate studies
  on these enigmatic insects, both by hymenopterists and phasmatologists.
