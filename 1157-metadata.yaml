title: World Foraminifera Database
alias: WoRMS Foraminifera
description: "This World Database of all species of Foraminifera ever described, is\
  \ part of the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), a global initiative to provide\
  \ a register of all marine organisms.\r\nForaminifera (‘hole bearers’) or forams\
  \ for short, are a large phylum of amoeboid protozoans (single celled) with reticulating\
  \ pseudopods, fine strands of cytoplasm that branch and merge to form a dynamic\
  \ net. They usually produce a test (or shell) which can have one or more chambers,\
  \ and are made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or mineral grains or other particles\
  \ glued together. The tests are usually less than 0.5 mm in size, but the largest\
  \ can be up to 20 cm across. Foraminifera are among the most abundant and scientifically\
  \ important groups of marine organisms. The tests of recently dead planktic foraminifera\
  \ are so abundant that they form a thick blanket over one third of the surface of\
  \ the Earth (as Globigerina ooze on the ocean floor). Foraminifera are essentially\
  \ marine- and estuarine-dwelling protozoans living in all environments from the\
  \ greatest depths right up to highest astronomical tide level and from the equator\
  \ to the poles.\r\n\r\nThe importance of foraminifera comes from the use of their\
  \ fossil tests in biostratigraphy, paleoenvironmental studies, and isotope geochemistry.\
  \ Their ubiquity in most marine sedimentary rocks, often as large, well-preserved,\
  \ diverse assemblages, has resulted in their being the most studied group of fossils\
  \ worldwide. Because modern foraminifera have attracted little interest from biologists,\
  \ paleontologists have been forced to undertake most studies, including genetic\
  \ research, on the living fauna.\r\nThis site has the following aims:\r\n    to\
  \ provide a catalogue of the world's foraminiferal species\r\n    to promote stability\
  \ in foraminiferal nomenclature\r\n    to act as a tool for higher taxonomic revisions\
  \ and regional monographs"
