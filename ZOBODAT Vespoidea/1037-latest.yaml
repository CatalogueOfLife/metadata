title: Zoological-Botanical Database (Vespoidea)
alias: ZOBODAT Vespoidea
description: ZOBODAT is a digitally organised biogeographical database including facilities
  for analysis, documentation and communication. Founded in 1972 by Univ.- Prof. Dr.
  Ernst Rudolf Reichl, ZOBODAT was taken over by the federal county of Upper Austria
  in 1999. It is located at the Biology Centre of the Museum of Upper Austria. The
  original database includes information about the temporal and spatial distribution
  of animal and plant species and various supporting information topics. Most of the
  data traditionally refer to insects of Austria, but ZOBODAT can be used for all
  groups of organisms and world-wide. ZOBODAT contributes world vespid wasps to the
  Catalogue of Life.
