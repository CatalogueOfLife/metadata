title: Fulgoromorpha Lists On the Web
alias: FLOW
description: FLOW is an on-line database that aims to provide an easy-access synthesis
  of available biological published primary data on planthoppers (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha),
  a group of major economic importance. It includes information on names, taxa (including
  fossils), and their classification but also on type depositories, bibliography,
  distribution and associated biological information such as host-plants. FLOW provides
  a dynamic link to MNHN Hemiptera specimen collection (particularly type specimens),
  GBIF occurrences, and provides photos when already available. Dynamic syntheses
  are also provided for all suprageneric taxa.
