title: World Asteroidea Database
alias: WoRMS Asteroidea
description: The core of the World Asteroidea Database (WAD) is derived from the "Asteroid
  Names List" developed primarily by Ailsa M. Clark. However the WAD is complimented
  by numerous other echinoderm compendia (e.g., Clark & Downey's Starfishes of the
  Atlantic, Rowe & Gate's Zoological Catalogue of Australia, etc) and will eventually
  include all subsequent taxonomic changes and newly described taxa. Data have been
  contributed to the Catalogue of Life via the WoRMS, hosted by the Flanders Marine
  Institute (VLIZ).
