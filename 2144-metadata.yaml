alias: ITIS
description: The Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov) was
  proposed in 1993 and established through a Memorandum of Understanding in 1996.
  ITIS partners with U.S. Federal agencies, other government agencies and organizations
  from the United States, Canada and Mexico, and with data stewards and experts from
  around the world to maintain an authoritative reference of scientific and common
  names of all seven Kingdoms of Life (Archaea, Bacteria, Protozoa, Chromista, Fungi,
  Plantae, and Animalia). For news and information about recent ITIS updates see www.itis.gov/whatsnew.html.
