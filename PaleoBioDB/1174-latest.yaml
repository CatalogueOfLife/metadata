title: The Paleobiology Database
alias: PaleoBioDB
description: The Paleobiology Database (PaleoBioDB) is a non-governmental, non-profit
  public resource for paleontological data. It has been organized and operated by
  a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological
  researchers. Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic
  data for organisms of all geological ages, as well data services to allow easy access
  to data for independent development of analytical tools, visualization software,
  and applications of all types. The Databaseâ€™s broader goal is to encourage and enable
  data-driven collaborative efforts that address large-scale paleobiological questions.
