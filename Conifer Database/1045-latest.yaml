title: Conifer Database
alias: Conifer Database
description: The Conifer database is a taxonomic and specimen database of all 615
  species of conifers in the world based on herbarium specimens from many herbaria.
  The database has been compiled primarily as a tool for taxonomic revisions and to
  produce checklists and monographs. Recent outputs have been A Handbook of the World's
  Conifers (2010) and An Atlas of the World's Conifers (2013), both by A. Farjon and
  published by Brill in Leiden. Work on the database is in progress. Over 4,000 new
  conifer common names in 20 languages and additional references have been contributed
  as a result of 4D4Life pilot projects.
