title: Illustrated catalog of Tessaratomidae
alias: Tessaratomidae Database
description: The objective of this database is to build an illustrated catalogue of
  the world Tessaratomidae. It will take some time, as the author has not seen all
  species in this family, not yet photographed all the bugs he has seen, and more
  is not sure, for half of them, of the species they belong to. It will evolve with
  the knowledge of the author, so any contribution is welcome (bugs, pictures, identification).
