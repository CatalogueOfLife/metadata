title: Psylloidea database
alias: Psyllist
description: Psyl'list is an online database dedicated to Jumping Plant-Lice (Insecta,
  Hemiptera, Psylloidea). The aim of this ongoing project is primarily to make up
  the absence of world catalogues for Psylloidea, in organizing taxonomic data and
  providing easy access to the published taxonomic data already available, but scattered
  in literature. In the future, information about Psylloidea morphology, host-plants
  and biogeography, as well as linked molecular data, will be added.
